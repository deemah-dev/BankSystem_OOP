# BankSystem

A simple banking system implemented in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.  
This project simulates a basic banking environment with multiple menus and user management functionalities.

## Features

- User login with username authentication.
- Management of users and clients.
- Account operations including:
- Add, edit, and delete clients or users.
  - Deposit
  - Withdrawal
  - Transfer
- Display of project files and data for review.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **IDE:** Visual Studio
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Running the Project

1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run the executable to interact with the banking system menus.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance security measures (password encryption, access control).
- Implement persistent database storage instead of file-based storage.
- Add error handling and input validation improvements.

## Notes

This is a learning project designed to practice OOP concepts in C++ and project structuring.  
Contributions or suggestions are welcome!
